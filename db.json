      "data": "When someone dies, tissues start to irreversibly degrade, but recently this irreversibility has been brought into question by studies showing that some organs can be partially revived several hours after death. Now, working in pigs, researchers have shown it is possible to revive the functions of several organs at once. This could pave the way for improved organ transplantation, but ethicists advise caution.",

      "data": "Backups come in three primary forms. A seed phrase, which is a 9-to-24 word passphrase of regular words. Or a wallet file backup, like a wallet.dat. Alternatively, it could be in the form of a private key, which is a long alphanumeric string. The kind of backup your wallet generates just depends on the wallet that you're using. So once you generate your backup, you will choose whether to email, Bluetooth, or Telegram it to yourself - among other options regardless of what kind it is.",
